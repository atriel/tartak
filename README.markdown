## Tartak

Tartak is a tool for creating lexers and parsers.

----

#### Prototype

The prototype is written in Python, but the final version will be rewritten in C++ for speed and
memory efficieny.  
The data serialization format is JSON so the middle-forms can be freely exchanged between Tartak parts
written in different languages.
